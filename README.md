# day-planner

Check out the [deployed page](https://bferriman.github.io/day-planner/)!

## Description

This page lets users schedule daily tasks and appointments on a 9:00 - 5:00 calendar.

## Features

Current day and time are displayed dynamically.

Each hour-long time block is color-coded to indicate its relative position to the current time.

User inputs are stored in localStorage and retrieved when they make subsequent visits to the page.

Responsive to changing screen size.

Dynamically displays button controls appropriate to the state of each time block.

## Opportunities For Further Development

I sometimes wish that hitting the enter key with focus on a textarea would trigger the Save button. On the other hand, that takes away text entry flexibility.

The app would be more useful if it allowed the user to save events for more than one day at a time.

The app could provide some kind of alert when a scheduled event is approaching.
